# CK2-Linux-Fix
Shell script that fixes the issue for launching Crusader Kings 2 on a unsupported Linux distribution.

Currently working only for Steam versions and assuming that the pathing to your Steam folder is the standard one.

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure that it has the necessary permissions. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory, then run:

```bash
chmod +x update_ck2_lib.sh
```

Then you can just run it with:
```bash
./update_ck2_lib.sh
```
